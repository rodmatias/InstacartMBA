Market Basket Analysis

## Business Situation
Instacart is an american company that provides a grocery delivery and pick-up
service via a website or mobile app in the United States and Canada.

## Metadata

This dataset is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over
time. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of 200,000 grocery
orders from more than 100,000 Instacart users. For each user, we provide a few
of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order.
Because the original dataset was too large, the products were grouped by their
types, resulting in a total of 134 generalized products.  We also provide the
week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time
between orders.



## Expected Outcomes

- What are the main types of consumer behavior in the business?
- Which types of products should have an extended amount of product offerings?
- Which types of products can be seen as substitutes?
- Which items are complementary?
